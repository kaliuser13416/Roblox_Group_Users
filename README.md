This is a simple program I made in about two days. It uses the Roblox Group API to retreive user IDs that are in a specific group. It outputs all of the User IDs into a text file of the same name as the Group ID (if the Group ID is 1111111 then the output file with be 1111111.txt). 
This output file will be outputted in your current working directory. On start up you will be prompted for the Group ID. Everything else is handled by the program.

Requirements:
Python 3
  json
  requests
